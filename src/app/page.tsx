            This is a team project, developed as part of the React course at
            Rolling Scopes School (RSSchool). Under the hood, we use Next.js and
            React for a performant, scalable UI and seamless routing. TypeScript
            provides strong typing and safer refactoring, while Tailwind CSS
            ensures a consistent, responsive design with minimal overhead. For
            reliability and confidence, we write unit and integration tests with
            Vitest, enabling rapid iteration without sacrificing quality.
