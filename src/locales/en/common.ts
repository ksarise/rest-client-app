    'This is a team project, developed as part of the React course at Rolling Scopes School (RSSchool). Under the hood, we use Next.js and React for a performant, scalable UI and seamless routing. TypeScript provides strong typing and safer refactoring, while Tailwind CSS ensures a consistent, responsive design with minimal overhead. For reliability and confidence, we write unit and integration tests with Vitest, enabling rapid iteration without sacrificing quality.',
